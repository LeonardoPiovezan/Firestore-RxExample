# Firestore-RxExample

# What is it?

This is a sample project that uses RxSwift alongside Firestore to create a dynamic view with labels and textfields.
My Firestore is set up to a login view.

# Install

In order to use it, please run pod install. Also, if you want to play with the labels and textfields , you need to create a firestore database, on firebase and change the GoogleService-Info.plist to your project.
